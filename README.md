# AngularSVG

Thanks to Mike Ryan (Software Architect, Synapse) for an awesome SVG presentation at Angular Colorado. 
This is a playground of SVG angular components.
I have 2 examples: Slider from Daz and Progress bar from Cory.
My first implementation is a histogram and cumulative-histogram (curve)
